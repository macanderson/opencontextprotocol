# Context Graph Protocol protocol surface

This is the normative shape of the Context Graph Protocol as bound to
Rust types by [`contextgraph-types`](https://crates.io/crates/contextgraph-types). Every type
below lives in that crate, round-trips through `serde_json`, and *is* the
protocol — there is no separate IDL. Field-level doc comments in the crate
are the ultimate source of truth; this page is a guided tour.

Protocol version: `PROTOCOL_VERSION = "contextgraph/1.0-draft"` (`contextgraph-types/src/lib.rs`).
See [`stability.md`](./stability.md) for what "draft" means and when it
freezes.

## The three modules

`contextgraph-types` is organized into three modules, re-exported from the crate root:

- [`capability`](#handshake--capability) — what a provider is and does,
  negotiated at the handshake.
- [`query`](#context-query) — the retrieval request/response shape.
- [`frame`](#context-frame) — the unit of exchange a provider returns.

## Handshake / capability

A provider identifies itself and what it does with data before a host ever
sends it a query.

```rust
pub struct DataFlow {
    pub reads: bool,   // can see workspace content via query payloads
    pub writes: bool,  // persists context/upsert writes
    pub egress: bool,  // sends anything off the local machine
    pub egress_scopes: Vec<EgressScope>, // WHERE content goes; empty = boolean-only posture (context-reuse §3)
}

pub struct ProviderInfo {
    pub name: String,
    pub version: String,
    pub data_flow: DataFlow,
}

pub struct Capabilities {
    pub query: QueryCapability,
    pub upsert: bool,
    pub graph: bool,
    pub embeddings_fingerprint: Option<String>,
    pub subscribe: bool,  // push invalidation (issue #6)
    pub verify: bool,     // answers context/verify (context-reuse §4); defaults false
}

// The closed egress-scope vocabulary (context-reuse §3), serialized as a flat
// string — the four base classes, plus namespaced `vendor:scope` extensions.
pub enum EgressScope {
    LocalOnly, OrgTenant, ThirdPartyIndex, ThirdPartyModel, Custom(String),
}

pub struct QueryCapability {
    pub kinds: Vec<String>,   // e.g. ["doc", "snippet"] — see FrameKind below
    pub filters: Vec<String>,
}
```

`DataFlow.egress` is the security-critical field. **A conforming host MUST
NOT auto-enable a provider that declares `egress: true`** — it must gate that
provider behind an explicit, one-time consent that names what leaves
(enforced by `contextgraph-host`'s `ConsentStore`; see
[Implementing a provider](./implementing-a-provider.md)).

## Context query

A request to a provider for context frames relevant to a goal. Every query
carries a token budget; a conforming provider never returns more than it and
never lies about the cost.

```rust
pub struct ContextQuery {
    pub goal: String,                    // the task/turn goal driving retrieval
    pub query_text: Option<String>,
    pub embedding: Option<Vec<f32>>,
    pub kinds: Vec<FrameKind>,           // empty = "give me your best frames of any kind"
    pub anchors: Vec<String>,            // open files / mentioned symbols, for proximity scoring
    pub max_frames: u32,
    pub max_tokens: u32,
    pub as_of: Option<String>,           // pin retrieval to a point in time (bi-temporal facts)
}

pub struct ContextQueryResult {
    pub frames: Vec<ContextFrame>,
    pub truncated: bool,                 // true if more candidates existed than fit the budget
    pub dropped_estimate: Option<u32>,
}
```

`ContextQueryResult` carries two helper methods any host can use:

- `total_token_cost() -> u64` — sum of `token_cost` across returned frames.
- `respects_budget(max_tokens: u32) -> bool` — whether that sum stayed within
  the query's budget. `contextgraph-host`'s fan-out router calls this on every
  response and drops (with a loud report) any provider whose frames fail it —
  a provider that returns more tokens than it claimed is exhibiting
  **budget dishonesty**, and its frames are never trusted into a prompt.

## Context frame

The unit of exchange returned from a query. Frames, never blobs, carry
relevance, cost, and provenance so a budgeting, citing host can compose
sources honestly.

```rust
pub enum FrameKind {
    Snippet, Symbol, Fact, Doc, Memory, Episode, Graph,
}

pub enum Representation { Full, Compact, Reference }   // absent ⇒ Full (legacy)

pub struct ContextFrame {
    pub id: String,                      // provider-scoped, stable for dedup across queries
    pub kind: FrameKind,
    pub title: String,                   // human label — never a bare uuid
    pub content: Option<String>,         // untrusted data; ABSENT for a reference frame
    pub content_digest: Option<String>,  // inline-content hash (the spec's content_hash); feeds FrameId
    pub uri: Option<String>,
    pub representation: Representation,   // full | compact | reference (omitted on the wire when full)
    pub content_fidelity: Option<ContentFidelity>,        // exact | normalized | summarized | omitted
    pub canonical_content_hash: Option<String>,           // hash of the COMPLETE source content
    pub content_ref: Option<ContentRef>,                  // opaque resolver handle (compact/reference)
    pub transform: Option<Transform>,                     // how a compact frame rendered its source
    pub minimum_content_fidelity: Option<ContentFidelity>,
    pub inline_content_requirement: Option<InlineContentRequirement>,
    pub score: f32,                      // provider-normalized relevance, [0, 1]
    pub token_cost: u32,                 // honest, conformance-audited inline token cost
    pub canonical_token_cost: Option<u32>,                // cost of the full source (if declared)
    pub tokenizer_ref: Option<String>,                    // e.g. "openai:o200k_base"
    pub valid_from: Option<String>,
    pub valid_to: Option<String>,
    pub recorded_at: Option<String>,
    pub provenance: Vec<Provenance>,
    pub citation_label: Option<String>,
    pub embedding: Option<FrameEmbedding>,
    pub relations: Vec<Relation>,
}

pub struct ContentRef {                  // content_ref.uri is distinct from ContextFrame.uri
    pub provider_id: String,             // the exact provider that returned this frame
    pub uri: String,                     // opaque resolver handle for context/resolve
    pub expires_at: Option<String>,
}

pub struct Provenance {
    pub kind: String,           // e.g. "file", "derivation", "episode" (serialized as "type")
    pub uri: Option<String>,
    pub range: Option<String>,
    pub digest: Option<String>,
    pub method: Option<String>,
    pub by: Option<String>,
}

pub struct Relation {
    pub rel: String,
    pub target_uri: String,
    pub display_name: Option<String>,    // a graph edge is surfaced by human label, never a raw id
}

pub struct FrameEmbedding {
    pub fingerprint: String,             // the vector payload itself is elidable
    pub vector: Option<Vec<f32>>,
}
```

Two contract points worth calling out explicitly, because the conformance
suite checks both:

- **`score` must be in `[0, 1]`.** `ContextFrame::has_valid_score()` is the
  cheap self-check any provider or host can run; `contextgraph-conformance`'s
  `frame-validity` check enforces it against real providers.
- **`title` and `citation_label` must never be empty.** A host must be able
  to cite a frame by a human label — an empty or missing citation label is a
  conformance failure, not a cosmetic gap. (Whole-platform convention: raw
  ids are never the primary on-screen identifier.)

### Frame representations

A frame states **how** it carries its content through `representation`. This is
additive: a legacy frame with no `representation` field is a `full` frame, and a
`full` frame omits the field on the wire, so pre-representation providers and
stored frames are unchanged.

| Representation | Inline `content` | `content_ref` + `canonical_content_hash` | `content_digest` (inline hash) | `transform` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `full`      | **required** | optional | optional | absent |
| `compact`   | **required** (a transformed rendering) | **required** | **required** | **required** |
| `reference` | **absent**   | **required** | absent | absent |

- A `reference` frame carries no inline content at all — only a `content_ref`
  (an opaque resolver handle) and a `canonical_content_hash` so a host can
  rehydrate honestly and verifiably. It is **never** encoded as `content: ""`;
  the field is omitted entirely.
- `ContextFrame.uri` identifies the source resource; `content_ref.uri` is a
  distinct opaque resolver handle, and `content_ref.provider_id` names the exact
  provider a fan-out host routes `context/resolve` back to.
- `content_digest` is the hash of the **inline** content bytes (the spec's
  `content_hash`, under its established name; it feeds `FrameId`);
  `canonical_content_hash` is the hash of the **complete source** content.

`ContextFrame::representation_invariants()` enforces the table above in code, and
the JSON Schema enforces it on the wire; providers should self-check, and a host
rejects a frame that lies about its shape.

**Negotiation.** A host states an ordered `ContextQuery.representation_preferences`
(absent ⇒ `[full]`); the provider returns the first representation it supports
(`ContextQuery::select_representation`) or answers `unsupported_representation`.
A provider advertises `Capabilities.representations` and `Capabilities.resolve`;
because `compact`/`reference` hand the host a `content_ref` to rehydrate,
advertising either **requires** `resolve` support
(`Capabilities::representations_consistent`).

## Reusing context across turns

A single retrieval is only half the story. Reusing retrieved context across the
turns of a session — cheaply, without serving stale evidence, and with an audit
trail — is governed by four interlocking guarantees specified in the companion
[**Context reuse**](./context-reuse.md) page: a stable **frame identity** and
canonical ordering for cache-friendly [deterministic composition](./context-reuse.md#1-deterministic-composition),
a per-request [usage report](./context-reuse.md#2-usage-reports) for metering,
[consent scopes and receipts](./context-reuse.md#3-consent-scopes-and-receipts)
for audit-grade egress records, and a pull-based
[`context/verify`](./context-reuse.md#4-context-verification) request for cheap
revalidation. They surface here as the `content_digest` frame field, the
`egress_scopes` data-flow field, the `verify` capability flag, and the
`verify` / `verified` envelope variants — all additive within the
`contextgraph/1` family. Their conformance requirements are consolidated below.

## Context verification

A host revalidates frames it already holds without re-sending any body
([context-reuse §4](./context-reuse.md#4-context-verification)). Sent only to a
provider advertising `verify`; otherwise the host re-queries.

```rust
pub struct VerifyRequest {
    pub frames: Vec<FrameId>,       // identities only — never frame bodies
}

pub struct FrameVerdict {
    pub frame: FrameId,             // echoed in full, so verdicts correlate by match not position
    pub verdict: Verdict,           // flattened: {"status": "...", ...}
}

pub enum Verdict {
    Valid,                                          // unchanged — may keep reusing
    Stale { replacement_digest: Option<String> },   // changed — a digest, never a body
    Gone,                                           // no longer exists
    Unknown,                                        // provider cannot say
}

pub struct VerifyResponse {
    pub verdicts: Vec<FrameVerdict>,
}
```

A host **MUST** keep reusing a frame only on an explicit `valid` — an identity
answered `unknown`, or not answered at all, is evicted like any other. Reuse
requires a positive answer, never the absence of a negative one.

## Wire framing (defined in `contextgraph-host`, not `contextgraph-types`)

`contextgraph-types` defines the payload shapes above; `contextgraph-host::wire::Envelope`
defines how they're framed on the wire — newline-delimited JSON (NDJSON), one
`serde_json` value per line over stdio, or one JSON body per streamable-HTTP
request/response. See [Implementing a provider](./implementing-a-provider.md)
for the full envelope vocabulary (`handshake` / `handshake_ack` / `query` /
`frames` / `verify` / `verified` / `shutdown` / `error`) and the version-compatibility rule. See
[`examples/`](../examples/) for diffable wire transcripts of a complete session,
or the [machine-readable JSON Schema](../schema/contextgraph-envelope.schema.json) to
validate messages in any language.

## Machine-readable schema

The wire shapes above are captured as a [JSON Schema (Draft 2020-12)](../schema/contextgraph-envelope.schema.json).
The root schema validates a single envelope (one message per NDJSON line / per
HTTP body); every payload type is also exposed under `$defs` for granular
validation. Because the wire format is JSON, any standard JSON Schema validator
works — `ajv` (JS/TS), Python `jsonschema`, the Rust `jsonschema` crate, or Go
`gojsonschema` — with no IDL compiler or language lock-in.

The schema encodes the structural conformance rules: required fields, `score ∈
[0,1]`, non-empty `title`/`citation_label`/`id`, the `FrameKind` enum, the
`contextgraph/MAJOR.MINOR(-draft)?` version-string pattern, u32 ranges, and the
`Provenance.kind` → `"type"` serialization rename. A message that validates
against the schema is structurally conformant; the `contextgraph-conformance` suite adds
the behavioral checks (budget honesty, malformed-input tolerance, clean
shutdown) that a schema alone cannot express.

Run `python3 schema/validate-examples.py` to check the bundled examples against
the schema — it doubles as a usage reference for wiring your own validator.

## Conformance requirements

This section is the consolidated, authoritative list of what a conforming
provider and host **MUST** do. The `contextgraph-conformance` suite checks the
provider-side requirements; a host built on `contextgraph-host` enforces the
host-side requirements. Bold keywords follow [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119).

### Handshake and versioning

| # | Requirement | Enforced / verified by |
| - | ----------- | ---------------------- |
| H1 | A provider **MUST** reply to `handshake` with a `handshake_ack` whose `protocol_version` is in the same major family as the host's. | `handshake` conformance check |
| H2 | The `provider.name` and `provider.version` fields **MUST NOT** be empty. | `handshake` conformance check |
| H3 | A version-family mismatch **MUST** be reported to the host as a named error, not left to hang. | `contextgraph-host::wire::versions_compatible` |

### Data flow and consent

| # | Requirement | Enforced / verified by |
| - | ----------- | ---------------------- |
| C1 | A conforming host **MUST NOT** auto-enable a provider that declares `data_flow.egress: true`. It **MUST** gate that provider behind explicit, named, revocable consent. | `ConsentStore` gate in `contextgraph-host` |
| C2 | The host **MUST NOT** transmit a query payload to an `egress` provider before consent is recorded. | `Host::query_provider` gate |
| C3 | A provider **SHOULD** declare `egress: true` honestly if it sends data off the local machine, directly or indirectly. | advisory; the host cannot rely solely on the claim — see C4 |
| C4 | `contextgraph-host`'s HTTP transport **MUST** treat every remote provider as `egress` regardless of its handshake claim. | `contextgraph-host` HTTP transport |

### Frame validity

| # | Requirement | Enforced / verified by |
| - | ----------- | ---------------------- |
| F1 | Every frame's `score` **MUST** be in the range `[0, 1]`. | `frame-validity` conformance check; `ContextFrame::has_valid_score()` |
| F2 | Every frame's `title` **MUST** be non-empty. | `frame-validity` conformance check |
| F3 | Every frame's `citation_label` **MUST** be non-empty. | `frame-validity` conformance check |

### Budget honesty

| # | Requirement | Enforced / verified by |
| - | ----------- | ---------------------- |
| B1 | The sum of `token_cost` across a provider's returned frames **MUST NOT** exceed the query's `max_tokens`. | `budget-honesty` conformance check; `ContextQueryResult::respects_budget` |
| B2 | A host **MUST** drop (with a loud report) the frames of any provider that violates B1, rather than silently truncating them. | `contextgraph-host::Host` budget audit |

### Robustness

| # | Requirement | Enforced / verified by |
| - | ----------- | ---------------------- |
| R1 | A provider **MUST NOT** crash on a malformed line or a bad request. It **SHOULD** reply `error` instead. | `malformed-input-tolerance` conformance check (stdio) |
| R2 | A provider **MUST** tear down cleanly on `shutdown` (stdio: exit; HTTP: no further requests expected). | `shutdown-clean` conformance check |
| R3 | Frame `content` **MUST** be treated as untrusted data by the host — delimited as quoted material, never executed as instructions. | `contextgraph-host` host contract |

### Context reuse

The full text for these lives in the companion [Context reuse](./context-reuse.md)
page; they are consolidated here because this section is the authoritative list.

| # | Requirement | Enforced / verified by |
| - | ----------- | ---------------------- |
| D1 | Frames sharing a `FrameId` **MUST** have identical content bytes; changing content **MUST** change `content_digest`. | provider contract; `verify` conformance check |
| D2 | A host composing a frame set **MUST** emit frames in canonical `FrameId` order, independent of arrival order, and **MUST NOT** let `score`/`token_cost` affect the rendered bytes. | `contextgraph-host::compose_context` |
| U1 | A host **MUST** be able to produce a usage report for any query it executed, whose consumed total equals the summed `token_cost` of the served frames it reports. | `contextgraph-host::FanOut::usage_report`; `usage-report` conformance check |
| C5 | A provider **MUST** declare its egress scopes (`egress_scopes`) truthfully and consistently with `data_flow.egress`; an off-machine scope alongside `egress: false` is a conformance failure. | `consent-scope` conformance check |
| C6 | A host **MUST** reject a frame whose provider declares an egress scope with no live matching [consent receipt](./context-reuse.md#3-consent-scopes-and-receipts), with a typed error, before transmitting the query. | `ConsentStore` scope gate |
| V1 | A provider advertising `verify` **MUST** answer honestly by comparing digests: `valid` when the presented digest matches what it currently serves, `stale` when it differs on a frame it still serves. It **MUST NOT** answer `valid` for content bytes it is not serving. | `verify-honesty` conformance check |
| V2 | A host **MUST** keep reusing a held frame only on an explicit `valid`; `stale`, `gone`, `unknown`, and a missing verdict all evict it. | `contextgraph-host::Host::verify_frames` default-deny partition |
| V3 | A host **MUST NOT** send `context/verify` to a provider that does not advertise `capabilities.verify`, and **MUST** fall back to re-querying those frames. | `Host::verify_frames` capability gate; `ContextProvider::verify` default |
| V4 | Neither a verify request nor its response **MAY** carry frame bodies; a `stale` verdict carries at most a replacement **digest**. | `VerifyRequest`/`VerifyResponse` shapes; `verify_wire` no-bodies test |

## Version strings

The protocol version string has the grammar:

```abnf
version-string = "contextgraph/" major "." minor [ "-draft" ]
major          = 1*DIGIT
minor          = 1*DIGIT
```

The **major family** is the substring up to (but not including) the first `.`
— e.g. the family of `contextgraph/1.0-draft` is `contextgraph/1`.

Two version strings interoperate if and only if they share a major family.
`contextgraph/1.0-draft` and `contextgraph/1.0` both belong to family `contextgraph/1` and interoperate;
`contextgraph/2.0` does not interoperate with either. The `-draft` suffix marks a
not-yet-frozen version within a family and does not affect interoperability.
This rule is implemented by `contextgraph-host::wire::versions_compatible`; an
out-of-Rust implementation **SHOULD** compare major families directly rather
than hardcoding a specific version string.

See [`stability.md`](./stability.md) for the crate-version vs. protocol-version
distinction and the draft-to-freeze model, and [`GOVERNANCE.md`](../GOVERNANCE.md)
for who decides the freeze.
