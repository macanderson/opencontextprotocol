# Context Graph Protocol (CGP) — normative specification

**Version:** `contextgraph/1.0-draft`

This document is the **single normative home** of the Context Graph Protocol.
A provider or host can be implemented from this document, the
[JSON Schema](./schema/contextgraph-envelope.schema.json), and the
[examples](./examples/) alone, without reading the reference Rust source.

> **Conformance language.** The key words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **SHOULD**,
> **SHOULD NOT**, and **MAY** are to be interpreted as described in
> [BCP 14 / RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119) when, and only
> when, they appear in **bold**.

> **Normative vs informative.** Wire shapes, the requirement tables, the version
> rule, and the counting and format grammars are **normative**. Reference-host
> behaviour (timeouts, the safety factor, composition strategy) is
> **informative** and explicitly marked.

Every requirement has a stable anchor (`H1`, `B3`, `F5`, …). Cite them from code
comments and bug reports; they will not be renumbered within the
`contextgraph/1` family.

## 1. What CGP is

CGP specifies **context retrieval**: typed, budgeted, provenance-carrying,
consent-gated, conformance-verified frames that a host composes into a prompt.

It does **not** specify tool invocation — that is
[MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)'s scope, and CGP will not absorb it. An
agent needing both composes them: CGP frames feed the prompt, MCP tools do the
work.

The unit of exchange is a **frame**, never a blob. A frame states what it is,
where it came from, what it costs, when it was true, and how to cite it — so a
host can budget, attribute, and verify rather than accept on faith.

---

## 2. Transport bindings

The **semantic layer** (frames, queries, capabilities) is defined independently
of its **transport binding**. One binding is defined in this revision.

### 2.1 NDJSON binding (normative)

Every message is a single JSON object — an *envelope* — tagged by a `type`
member.

- **stdio:** exactly one envelope per line, newline-delimited (NDJSON). An
  envelope **MUST NOT** contain a literal newline.
- **HTTP:** one envelope as the request body, one as the response body.

Envelope vocabulary: `handshake`, `handshake_ack`, `query`, `frames`,
`verify`, `verified`, `shutdown`, `error`.

A receiver **MUST** ignore an envelope member it does not recognise rather than
rejecting the message; a receiver **MUST NOT** reject an envelope solely because
its `type` is one it does not implement — it replies `error` with code
`bad_request` for a payload-bearing request it cannot serve, and ignores an
unrecognised notification. This is what lets the vocabulary grow additively
within the `contextgraph/1` family (§13).

**CGP is not JSON-RPC.** There is no `jsonrpc` member and no `method`/`params`
split. Its lifecycle is *informed* by MCP — a handshake negotiating version and
capabilities before any payload moves — but the framing is its own. A JSON-RPC
binding **MAY** be specified later as an alternate encoding of this same
semantic layer, without a new protocol family. See
[ADR 0002](./docs/adr/0002-request-correlation-and-the-json-rpc-question.md).

---

## 3. Handshake, versioning, and correlation

The host opens with `handshake`; the provider replies `handshake_ack` carrying
its protocol version, identity, and capabilities. **No query payload moves
before this exchange completes.**

| # | Requirement | Verified by |
| - | ----------- | ----------- |
| **H1** | A provider **MUST** reply to `handshake` with a `handshake_ack` whose `protocol_version` is in the same major family as the host's. | `handshake` check |
| **H2** | `provider.name` and `provider.version` **MUST NOT** be empty. | `handshake` check |
| **H3** | A version-family mismatch **MUST** be reported as a named error, never left to hang. | `versions_compatible`; `handshake` check |
| **H4** | A provider declaring `capabilities.correlation` **MUST** echo a request's `id` verbatim on the corresponding `frames` or `error`. | `CorrelationMismatch`; `drop-correlation-id` witness |

### 3.1 Version strings

```abnf
version-string = "contextgraph/" major "." minor [ "-draft" ]
major          = 1*DIGIT
minor          = 1*DIGIT
```

The **major family** is the substring up to (not including) the first `.`. Two
versions interoperate **if and only if** they share a major family.
`contextgraph/1.0-draft` and `contextgraph/1.0` both belong to `contextgraph/1`
and interoperate; `contextgraph/2.0` does not.

This is what lets the freeze drop `-draft` without a flag day. An
implementation **SHOULD** compare major families rather than hardcoding a
version string.

### 3.2 Correlation

`query`, `frames`, and `error` **MAY** carry an `id`: an opaque host-generated
string, unique among the exchanges in flight on one connection.

- A host **MUST NOT** send an `id` to a provider that did not declare
  `capabilities.correlation`; such a provider is queried in lock-step and is
  fully conformant.
- An envelope with no `id` is a **notification** — it expects no reply. This is
  the shape a future push extension needs; no notification is defined in this
  revision.
- Correlation is negotiated **explicitly**, not by observation. A reply carrying
  no `id` would otherwise be ambiguous between "does not implement correlation"
  and "implements it incorrectly", and a guarantee whose violation is
  indistinguishable from legitimate behaviour cannot be checked.

---

## 4. Data flow and consent

`DataFlow` is the security-critical declaration, surfaced to the user at
install/consent time.

- **`reads`** — can see workspace content via query payloads.
- **`writes`** — durably persists data derived from what it receives (indexing
  payloads, retaining logs). A *consent-surface declaration*; it does not imply
  a host-callable write method, and none exists in this revision.
- **`egress`** — sends anything off the local machine.

| # | Requirement | Verified by |
| - | ----------- | ----------- |
| **C1** | A host **MUST NOT** auto-enable a provider declaring `egress: true`. It **MUST** gate it behind explicit, named, revocable consent. | `ConsentStore` |
| **C2** | A host **MUST NOT** transmit a query payload to an egress provider before consent is recorded. | `Host::query_provider` |
| **C3** | A provider **SHOULD** declare `egress: true` honestly if data leaves the machine, directly or indirectly. | advisory — see C4 |
| **C4** | A host's HTTP transport **MUST** treat every non-loopback provider as egress regardless of its handshake claim. | HTTP transport |
| **C5** | A provider **MUST NOT** declare an off-machine `egress_scope` alongside `egress: false` — a local posture that names a destination content leaves is a contradiction a host rejects at the handshake. | `DataFlow::scopes_consistent` |
| **C6** | A host **MUST** refuse a query, with a typed error naming the scopes, when a provider declares off-machine egress scopes and any such scope has no recorded consent receipt; the payload **MUST NOT** be transmitted. | `ConsentStore::evaluate`; `scope-lie` witness |
| **C7** | A host's HTTP transport **MUST** use TLS for every non-loopback provider, and **MUST** refuse to transmit a query payload to a non-loopback provider over an unencrypted connection. | HTTP transport |
| **C8** | A host **MUST NOT** log, or place in an error surfaced off-machine, any bearer token, credential, or authorization header used to reach a provider. | HTTP transport |

C4 is the load-bearing one: C3 is a claim, and a protocol that trusted claims
about egress would have no security story at all. The transport overrides the
declaration because the transport *knows*.

### 4.1 Egress scopes and consent receipts

A provider **MAY** declare, alongside the boolean `egress`, the *egress scopes*
its served content falls under — a closed vocabulary that classes *where*
content goes, so consent can be recorded per destination rather than as one
undifferentiated bit. The four normative base classes are `local-only`,
`org-tenant`, `third-party-index`, and `third-party-model`; everything but
`local-only` is off-machine. The vocabulary is extensible by a namespaced custom
scope (`vendor:name`, a `:` with non-empty sides), and an unrecognised custom
scope is treated as off-machine — the conservative default is that an unknown
destination *leaves*, so a host never under-gates. A scope is declared at the
provider level and governs every frame that provider serves; there is no
per-frame scope.

When a host grants consent it records an append-only *consent receipt* pinning
the provider identity, the exact scope, the grantor, and the grant time — turning
"is this allowed?" into a durable "what left, to whom, who agreed, and when?".
The full model, the receipt shape, and the audit rationale are in
[`docs/context-reuse.md` §3](./docs/context-reuse.md). A receipt is a host-side
artifact, not a wire message: a provider implements nothing to make one possible.

### 4.2 Transport security (C7–C8)

The NDJSON binding over stdio is a local pipe with no network exposure. Over
HTTP, a non-loopback provider is reached across a network the host does not
control, so C7 requires TLS and C8 forbids leaking the credentials used to
authenticate to it. These bind the *host's* transport, not the provider, and
join C4 as rules the transport enforces regardless of what a provider claims:
a host that would send workspace content to a remote provider in cleartext, or
spill its bearer token into a log, has no egress-security story at all. A
provider **MAY** require a bearer credential; how a host obtains and stores one
is host machinery and outside this revision.

---

## 5. Query

```jsonc
{
  "type": "query",
  "id": "q1",
  "query": {
    "goal": "why does the retry loop give up",
    "query_text": "retry loop",          // optional
    "embedding": [0.01, -0.2],           // optional; see E1
    "kinds": ["snippet"],                // empty = any kind
    "anchors": ["file:///repo/src/net.rs"],
    "max_frames": 8,
    "max_tokens": 2000,
    "as_of": "2026-07-01T00:00:00Z"      // optional; see F4
  }
}
```

`anchors` are URIs the host considers focal (open files, mentioned symbols). A
graph-capable provider **SHOULD** boost frames within a small number of relation
hops of an anchor. The ranking algorithm stays provider-private; the *contract*
is only that anchors bias relevance.

### 5.1 Embedding space (E1)

| # | Requirement |
| - | ----------- |
| **E1** | A host **MUST NOT** populate `query.embedding` unless its own embedding fingerprint is **exactly equal** to the provider's declared `capabilities.embeddings_fingerprint`. A provider receiving a vector whose length contradicts its declared dimension **SHOULD** reply `bad_request`. |

Fingerprint grammar: `<model-id>/<dimensions>[/<normalization>]`, e.g.
`bge-small-en-v1.5/384/l2`. Equality is exact rather than model-id-only, because
dimension and normalization both change what a vector *means*: a 384-dim
unnormalized vector sent to an index of 384-dim L2-normalized vectors yields
plausible-looking, meaningless scores — the silent wrongness CGP exists to make
loud.

---

## 6. Frames

```jsonc
{
  "id": "frm_retry",
  "kind": "snippet",
  "title": "net.rs L120-160",
  "content": "…",
  "uri": "file:///repo/src/net.rs",
  "score": 0.83,
  "token_cost": 42,
  "valid_from": "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "recorded_at": "2026-07-20T18:00:00Z",
  "provenance": [{ "type": "file", "uri": "…", "range": "L120-160",
                   "digest": "sha256:<64 hex>" }],
  "citation_label": "net.rs L120-160",
  "relations": [{ "rel": "code.calls", "target_uri": "…",
                  "display_name": "net::retry" }]
}
```

`kind` is one of `snippet`, `symbol`, `fact`, `doc`, `memory`, `episode`,
`graph`.

**Frame `content` is untrusted data.** It is evidence, not instruction.

| # | Requirement | Verified by |
| - | ----------- | ----------- |
| **F1** | `score` **MUST** be in `[0, 1]`. | `frame-validity` |
| **F2** | `title` **MUST** be non-empty. | `frame-validity` |
| **F3** | `citation_label` **MUST** be non-empty — a host must be able to cite a frame by a human label, never a bare id. | `frame-validity` |
| **F4** | `valid_from`, `valid_to`, `recorded_at`, and `as_of` **MUST** match `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS(.f+)?Z`. | `frame-validity` |
| **F5** | Provenance of kind `file` **MUST** carry a digest matching `sha256:<64 lowercase hex>`. | `frame-validity` |

### 6.1 Temporal profile (F4)

The profile is a **strict subset** of RFC 3339: uppercase `T`, uppercase `Z`,
UTC only. RFC 3339 also permits lowercase `t`, a space separator, and numeric
offsets; those are **not** conformant here. One spelling per instant means two
frames with the same instant compare equal as strings, which the dedup and
cache-key properties depend on. Naming it a subset rather than "RFC 3339" is
deliberate accuracy.

Semantics: `valid_from`/`valid_to` bound when the content was *true in the
world*; `recorded_at` is when the provider *learned* it. `as_of` pins retrieval
to an instant.

### 6.2 Digests (F5)

Grammar: `sha256:<64 lowercase hex>`. Lowercase is mandated, not conventional —
digests are compared byte-for-byte, and a case disagreement is indistinguishable
from tampering.

**Digested bytes:** the exact UTF-8 source bytes addressed by `uri` + `range` at
retrieval time, with **no normalization** (no line-ending translation, no
trailing-newline adjustment). Provenance without a `range` digests the whole
resource.

Only `file` provenance is held to F5: a `derivation` or `episode` link has no
addressable bytes, so requiring a digest of it would be theatre.

### 6.3 Frame identity (D1–D4)

A frame's stable identity is the triple *(provider id, frame id,
`content_digest`)*. `content_digest` is the provider-declared SHA-256 over the
frame's exact **inline** content bytes; it is opaque to the protocol
(`sha256:<hex>`) and is the spine shared by deterministic composition, usage
reports, and verification (§9). It is distinct from `canonical_content_hash`,
the SHA-256 over the *complete source* content that a `compact`/`reference`
frame carries so a resolved rehydration can be checked (§6.4).

| # | Requirement | Verified by |
| - | ----------- | ----------- |
| **D1** | `content_digest`, when present, **MUST** match `sha256:<64 lowercase hex>`. | `frame-validity` |
| **D2** | Two frames with the same *(provider id, frame id, `content_digest`)* **MUST** be treated as the same content; a host **MAY** dedup or reuse across queries on that basis. | host composition |
| **D3** | A frame whose `content_digest` is absent **MUST NOT** be reused unchecked across queries — a host re-queries or re-verifies it rather than trusting a stored copy. | host composition |
| **D4** | A `content_digest` is a claim about the *inline* bytes only; a host that reuses a frame's body across queries **SHOULD** confirm the identity still holds via `verify` (§9) before trusting it. | `verify` |

The identity rules and the reuse discipline they enable are developed in full in
[`docs/context-reuse.md` §1](./docs/context-reuse.md).

### 6.4 Representations (P1–P5)

A frame declares **how** it carries its content through `representation`, one of
`full`, `compact`, `reference`. Absent means `full`, so a frame emitted before
this field existed round-trips unchanged.

- **`full`** — the content is inline. The legacy default; the `representation`
  field is omitted on the wire.
- **`compact`** — an inline *transformed* rendering (a distillation, a
  truncation) travels with the frame, alongside the metadata to fetch or verify
  the original: `content`, `content_digest` (of the inline bytes),
  `canonical_content_hash` (of the full source), a `transform` identity, and a
  `content_ref`.
- **`reference`** — no inline content at all: only a `content_ref` handle and the
  `canonical_content_hash`, for a host that will rehydrate the full source.

| # | Requirement | Verified by |
| - | ----------- | ----------- |
| **P1** | A `full` frame **MUST** carry `content` and **MUST NOT** carry `content_ref`, `transform`, or `canonical_content_hash`. | `frame-validity` |
| **P2** | A `compact` frame **MUST** carry all of `content`, `content_digest`, `canonical_content_hash`, `transform`, and `content_ref`. | `frame-validity` |
| **P3** | A `reference` frame **MUST** carry `content_ref` and `canonical_content_hash`, and **MUST NOT** carry `content` (not even `""`), `content_digest`, or `transform`. | `frame-validity` |
| **P4** | `token_cost` is the honest cost of the **inline** rendering only (B3, §7): a `reference` frame therefore declares `token_cost: 0`, and a `compact` frame declares the cost of its *distilled* inline bytes — never the full-source cost, which belongs in the separate optional `canonical_token_cost`. | `budget-honesty` |
| **P5** | A host **MUST NOT** populate `query.representation_preferences` with a representation the provider did not advertise in `capabilities.representations`; a provider asked for an unadvertised representation **SHOULD** reply `error` with code `unsupported_representation`, or fall back to `full`. | capability negotiation |

### 6.4.1 `content_ref`, resolve, and the 1.0 scope boundary

A `content_ref` is an **opaque resolver handle** — a `provider_id` naming the
provider that returned the frame, a handle `uri` distinct from the frame's own
`uri`, and an optional `expires_at`. It is the coordinate a host would hand back
to obtain the full source of a `compact` or `reference` frame.

**`context/resolve` is not defined in `contextgraph/1.0`.** There is no resolve
envelope, and a host has no protocol-defined operation that turns a `content_ref`
into bytes. Resolution is reserved for a `1.x` additive minor (§13); a design
sketch lives under [`docs/sketches/`](./docs/sketches/). This has three
consequences a 1.0 implementer **MUST** understand:

- A provider communicating over a transport binding (stdio, HTTP) **SHOULD NOT**
  return `reference` frames, because the host cannot rehydrate them over the wire
  in 1.0. It **SHOULD** return `compact` (which self-carries a usable inline
  rendering) or `full` instead. An **in-process** provider sharing the host's
  address space **MAY** use `reference`, since rehydration is then a host-internal
  concern outside this protocol.
- `capabilities.resolve` is a **forward-declaration**. A provider advertising
  `compact` or `reference` **MUST** set `resolve: true` — a promise it can
  re-serve the full content of what it references — but no `1.0` wire operation
  exercises that promise. The consistency rule (`compact`/`reference` ⇒
  `resolve`) is a shape check on the handshake, not an obligation a host can call.
- A host composing a `reference` frame it cannot rehydrate **MUST** treat its
  contribution as empty rather than fabricating content.

Freezing the representation *fields* now — they already travel on the wire — while
deferring the resolve *operation* keeps 1.0 honest: it ships no capability a host
cannot use, and the operation arrives later as a clean additive minor rather than
a breaking change.

---

## 7. Budget honesty

The flagship guarantee, and the one most easily faked.

| # | Requirement | Verified by |
| - | ----------- | ----------- |
| **B1** | The sum of `token_cost` across returned frames **MUST NOT** exceed the query's `max_tokens`. | `budget-honesty` |
| **B2** | A host **MUST** drop, with a loud report, the frames of any provider violating B1 — never silently truncate them. | host budget audit |
| **B3** | `token_cost` **MUST** equal `ceil(utf8_byte_length(content) / 4)`. | `budget-honesty` |
| **B4** | The number of returned frames **MUST NOT** exceed `max_frames`. | `budget-honesty` |

### 7.1 Why B3 exists

Without it, B1 verified *arithmetic, not truth*: a provider declaring
`token_cost: 1` on a ten-thousand-token frame satisfied B1 perfectly while
destroying the host's real budget. B3 anchors each summand to bytes both parties
observe.

Equality is exact, with no tolerance band. Any band wide enough to absorb
genuine tokenizer disagreement is also wide enough to hide meaningful
under-reporting. A provider cannot "disagree" with a byte count.

### 7.2 Budget tokens are an accounting unit, not a tokenizer

A budget token is **not** a prediction of any model's tokenizer, and a host
**MUST NOT** treat one as one model token. The unit exists to make claims
comparable and verifiable across implementations, which no real tokenizer can do
without being mandated in every language.

It is honest about its bias: at ~4 bytes/token it tracks English prose, and it
**under-estimates** dense source code (~3–3.5 bytes/token) and CJK (~3
bytes/token). A host therefore maps its real model budget into budget tokens
with a safety factor. *(Informative: the reference host suggests 1.35.)*

**Scope:** the count covers `content` only — not `title`, `citation_label`,
provenance, or the host's own fences and labels. `content` is the one field the
provider controls whose exact bytes both sides observe, which is what makes a
byte-exact check possible. The host's rendering chrome is the host's cost to
budget.

*(Informative: exact tokenizer agreement may return as an additive 1.x
refinement — an optional handshake tokenizer id plus an optional exact count. It
does not disturb the floor established here.)*

---

## 8. Graph

CGP is named for the graph, and the graph is carried in `relations`: a graph
frame is **a node with its labelled edges**, not an ad-hoc serialization format.
`content` remains human-readable prose, consistent with every other kind, because
content is what goes into a prompt.

| # | Requirement | Verified by |
| - | ----------- | ----------- |
| **G1** | Every `Relation` **MUST** carry a non-empty `display_name` — an edge is surfaced by human label, never a raw id. | `frame-validity` |
| **G2** | `target_uri` **MUST** be a non-empty URI. | `frame-validity` |
| **G3** | A provider declaring `capabilities.graph` **SHOULD** boost frames within a small number of relation hops of a query `anchor`. | advisory |

### 8.1 Relation vocabulary (SHOULD)

The `rel` vocabulary is **open** — a host **MUST NOT** reject an unknown value.
These names are published so independent providers converge instead of each
inventing `calls` / `call` / `code.call`:

`code.calls` · `code.imports` · `code.defines` · `code.references` ·
`doc.documents` · `episode.follows`

Provider-specific edges belong under their own namespace (`myindex.owns`), which
keeps the shared namespace meaningful.

---

## 9. Verification

A host that holds frames from an earlier query can ask the provider whether they
are still current, instead of blindly re-querying. This is the pull half of
staleness handling; a push extension (a provider volunteering invalidations) is
a notification-shaped 1.x addition (§13) and is not defined here.

```jsonc
// host → provider
{ "type": "verify", "id": "v1",
  "request": { "frames": [
    { "provider_id": "code-graph", "frame_id": "frm_retry",
      "content_digest": "sha256:<64 hex>" }
  ] } }

// provider → host
{ "type": "verified", "id": "v1",
  "response": { "verdicts": [
    { "frame": { "provider_id": "code-graph", "frame_id": "frm_retry",
                 "content_digest": "sha256:<64 hex>" },
      "status": "stale",
      "replacement_digest": "sha256:<64 hex>" }
  ] } }
```

A verify request carries frame **identities** (§6.3), never bodies. Each verdict
echoes the identity it answers *in full*, so a host correlates by matching rather
than by position and a provider that reorders or omits entries cannot shift a
`valid` onto the wrong frame.

| # | Requirement | Verified by |
| - | ----------- | ----------- |
| **V1** | A `verify` request **MUST** carry frame identities only — no frame bodies. A host **SHOULD** include only identities carrying a `content_digest`; a digest-less frame cannot be revalidated and is re-queried instead. | `verify-honesty` |
| **V2** | A provider declaring `capabilities.verify` **MUST** answer a `verify` with a `verified` reply. A requested identity that comes back with no verdict **MUST** be treated by the host as `unknown`. | `verify-honesty`; `rubber-stamp-verify`, `hollow-verify` witnesses |
| **V3** | A verdict is one of `valid`, `stale`, `gone`, `unknown`. A host **MUST** reuse a held frame body **only** on `valid`; `unknown` **MUST NOT** be read as validity. Reuse requires a positive answer, never the absence of a negative one. | `verify-honesty` |
| **V4** | A `stale` verdict **MAY** carry a `replacement_digest` — the provider's current digest for the frame, a digest never a body. A host **MUST NOT** keep serving its stored copy of a `stale` or `gone` frame. | `verify-honesty` |

A provider that does not declare `capabilities.verify` is queried afresh each
time and stays fully conformant — verification is an optimisation a host earns by
handshake, never an assumption. When a provider declares `capabilities.correlation`,
a `verify`/`verified` pair is correlated by `id` exactly as `query`/`frames` are
(H4). The verdict semantics and the reuse discipline are developed in
[`docs/context-reuse.md` §4](./docs/context-reuse.md).

---

## 10. Errors

```jsonc
{ "type": "error", "id": "q1", "code": "unsupported_kind",
  "message": "this provider serves only 'doc' frames" }
```

`code` is for the machine; `message` is for whoever reads the log. Both are
carried — neither replaces the other.

| code | meaning | host reaction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bad_request` | malformed or unintelligible query | do not retry |
| `unsupported_kind` | requested kinds not served | narrow or skip |
| `unsupported_representation` | requested representation not offered | re-request `full` or skip |
| `incompatible_version` | handshake version families do not share a major (H3) | do not retry; the provider is unusable |
| `budget_unsatisfiable` | budget too small for any meaningful frame | raise budget or skip |
| `unavailable` | transient overload, backing store down | retry with backoff |
| `shutting_down` | provider is tearing down | re-spawn or drop |
| `internal` | provider fault | report, count against health |

`incompatible_version` is the named error H3 requires — a version-family mismatch
is permanent, so a host **MUST NOT** read it as retryable. `unsupported_representation`
is what a provider replies when a host requests a representation it did not
advertise (§6.4).

| # | Requirement |
| - | ----------- |
| **X1** | The `code` vocabulary is **open**. An unrecognised code **MUST** be treated as `internal`. |
| **X2** | An absent `code` **MUST** be treated as `internal`. |

X1 and X2 both default to the conservative reading: a host must never infer
"safe to retry" from a code it does not understand, or from silence. This is
also what lets the vocabulary grow in a 1.x minor without breaking deployed
hosts.

---

## 11. Robustness

| # | Requirement | Verified by |
| - | ----------- | ----------- |
| **R1** | A provider **MUST NOT** crash on a malformed line or bad request. It **SHOULD** reply `error` with code `bad_request`. | `malformed-input-tolerance` |
| **R2** | A provider **MUST** tear down cleanly on `shutdown`. | `shutdown-clean` |
| **R3** | A host **MUST** treat frame `content` as untrusted data — delimited as quoted material, never executed as instructions. | host contract *(see gap below)* |

### 11.1 Known enforcement gaps

Listing these is deliberate. A conformance suite that quietly omitted the rules
it cannot check would be exactly the self-attestation this project rejects.

The **host-side harness** (`contextgraph-conformance`'s `host_conformance`
module, issue #14) closes most of the host-binding gaps that once lived here. It
drives the reference host against adversarial in-process providers — the
host-side equivalent of the provider fixture's `--misbehave` modes — and asserts
the host: **B2** drops an over-budget provider with a report; **B4** drops a
frame-flooding one; **C1/C2** never queries, nor transmits a payload to, an
unconsented egress provider; **C6** refuses an unreceipted off-machine scope with
a typed error; **F5-bytes** verifies a `file`-provenance digest against the
re-read source over a trusted local fixture (via `contextgraph_host::verify`,
issue #12); and **R3** delimits frame `content` as quoted material inside a
fence. Run it: `contextgraph-inspect host` (CI: `host-conformance.sh`).

What remains genuinely unchecked:

- **C4, C7, C8 — the HTTP transport rules.** Treating every non-loopback
  provider as egress (C4), requiring TLS (C7), and never logging credentials
  (C8) are properties of the host's HTTP client; exercising them needs a real
  non-loopback, TLS network peer the in-process harness cannot stand up. They
  remain the host-side harness's next increment.
- **R3 delimiting is checked; breakout-resistance is not.** The harness proves
  `content` is fenced as quoted material, but the reference `compose_context`
  does not escape a content-embedded fence token — hardened, injection-resistant
  delimiting (an unguessable fence, escaping) is the composition module, issue
  #15.
- **F5-bytes verifies a host-trusted source, not any provider-named `uri`.** The
  verifier re-reads a path the host chooses to trust; automatically re-reading an
  arbitrary `uri` a provider supplies is a capability decision (path confinement,
  consent) that stays future work.

## 12. Conformance

"CGP conformant" means **green on `contextgraph-conformance` for your declared
capability set** — a checkable claim, not a self-attestation.

Run it:

```bash
contextgraph-inspect stdio -- ./your-provider
contextgraph-inspect stdio --json -- ./your-provider   # machine-readable
```

The suite is adversarial by construction: the bundled reference provider has
`--misbehave` modes that each break exactly one guarantee, and CI asserts every
mode is **caught**. A suite that only ever passes proves nothing about its
ability to catch a broken provider.

## 13. Extensibility and forward compatibility

The freeze drops `-draft` without a flag day (§3.1) only if a `contextgraph/1.0`
implementation can safely receive a message a later `1.x` peer emits. That
requires a stated rule for what "receive" does with surface the receiver was not
built to know about. These rules are normative; they are what make the additive
bias of §14 real rather than aspirational.

| # | Requirement |
| - | ----------- |
| **U1** | A receiver **MUST** ignore an object member it does not recognise, in any envelope, capability set, frame, or nested object — it **MUST NOT** reject the message on that basis. This is what lets a `1.x` minor add an optional field that a `1.0` peer harmlessly drops. |
| **U2** | The `FrameKind` set (`snippet`, `symbol`, `fact`, `doc`, `memory`, `episode`, `graph`) is **closed within a major family**; a new kind is a `1.x` addition. A host that receives an unrecognised `kind` **MUST** treat the frame as opaque evidence — it **MAY** ignore it, but **MUST NOT** crash. New *open* vocabularies (`rel`, error `code`, `egress_scope`) grow without a version bump; a receiver **MUST NOT** reject an unknown value in any of them (§8.1, §10 X1, §4.1). |
| **U3** | Names containing a `:` are **reserved for namespacing**: a vendor-specific `rel`, `egress_scope`, or error `code` **MUST** be namespaced (`vendor:name`, non-empty on both sides) so it can never collide with a base value this spec defines or later reserves. Unprefixed names in these vocabularies belong to the protocol. |
| **U4** | A field this spec defines is never repurposed within `contextgraph/1`: its name, type, and meaning are stable. A field that is superseded is **deprecated** — kept parseable and documented as deprecated for the life of the major family — never deleted or redefined. Deletion or redefinition requires a new major family (§3.1). |

**Unknown-field handling is load-bearing, not a courtesy.** The reference types
ignore unknown members on deserialization; a stricter validator (for authoring or
CI) **MAY** reject them, but a validator on the *interop* path — deciding whether
to accept a peer's message — **MUST** follow U1. The JSON Schema in this
repository is published in an authoring-strict profile (`additionalProperties:
false`) to catch typos in fixtures; that strictness is a lint, not the interop
contract, and U1 governs the wire.

Together U1–U4 are the mechanism behind the one-line promise that the freeze
"drops `-draft` without a flag day": a `1.0` peer and a `1.5` peer interoperate
because the `1.0` peer ignores what it does not know, the vocabularies it does
know only ever grew, and nothing it relied on was moved out from under it.

## 14. Changing this specification

See [GOVERNANCE.md](./GOVERNANCE.md). A normative change needs an issue, a PR
updating this document and `CHANGELOG.md`, and a **witness** — a conformance
check or a wire example. The bias is additive: a new optional field is a minor
change; a removed or renamed field requires a new major family (§13 U4).

Pre-freeze, `docs/stability.md` permits breaking changes on a `0.x → 0.y` bump.
Decisions taken under that latitude are recorded in [`docs/adr/`](./docs/adr/).
